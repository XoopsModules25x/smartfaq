    <h4 class="odd">Description</h4>

    <p class="even">SmartFAQ, as you would probably have guessed it by the name, is a Frequently Asked Questions system for XOOPS 2.x web sites. Compared to XoopsFaq or WF-FAQ, SmartFAQ offers exciting new functionality that will help communities to quickly and easily build a complete FAQ system for
        their sites.<br/> <br/>
        Here is some of the features of SmartFAQ :<br/> <br/>

        - Users can request a Q&A<br/> <br/>
        - Accepted requests are published in the Open Questions section.<br/> <br/>
        - Users can see, in the Open Questions section, the questions that are yet unanswered.<br/> <br/>
        - Users can propose answers to these questions.<br/> <br/>
        - When an answer is approved, the Q&A is published in the Q&A section.<br/> <br/>
        - Each Q&A can have other information like a 'Did you know?' and 'How do I?' statement.<br/> <br/>
        - These statements can be randomly displayed in blocks, along with a link for the complete answer.<br/> <br/>
        - Q&A can be linked to a specific module or a specific URL.<br/> <br/>
        - If such a link is made, the Contextual Q&A block will display contextual Q&A relatively to where the user is on your site.<br/> <br/>
        - At any time, users can submit a better answer for a Q&A that already has an answer. This newly submitted answer will obviously need to be appoved by a moderator.<br/> <br/>
