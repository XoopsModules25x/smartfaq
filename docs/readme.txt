What is SmartFAQ?
=================

SmartFAQ, as you would probably have guessed it by the name, is a Frequently Asked Questions system for XOOPS 2.x websites. Compared to XoopsFaq or WF-FAQ, SmartFAQ offers exciting new functionnalities that will help communities to quickly and easily build a complete FAQ system for their sites. Here is some of the features of SmartFAQ :

=> Users can request a Q&A
=> Accepted requests are published in the Open Questions section.
=> Users can see, in the Open Questions section, the questions that are yet unanswered.
=> Users can propose answers to these questions.
=> When an answer is approved, the Q&A is published in the Q&A section.
=> Each Q&A can have other information like a 'Did you know?' and 'How do I?' statement.
=> These statements can be randomly displayed in blocks, along with a link for the complete answer.
=> Q&A can be linked to a specific module or a specific URL.
=> If such a link is made, the Contextual Q&A block will display contextual Q&A relatively to where the user is on your site.
=> At any time, users can submit a better answer for a Q&A that already has an answer. This newly submitted answer will obviously need to be appoved by a moderator.

If you are interested, I've set up a demo site for you to see the potential of SmartFAQ. You can access this demo here :

How to install SmartFAQ
=======================

SmartFAQ is installed as a regular XOOPS module, which means you should copy the complete /smartfaq folder into the /modules directory of your website. Then, log in to your site as administrator, go to System Admin > Modules, look for the SmartFAQ icon in the list of uninstalled modules and click in the install icon. Follow the directions in the screen and you'll be ready to go.

Credits

SmartFAQ is the result of multiple ideas from multiple people and a work of outstanding collaboration. It all began with Herko talking to me about a 'contextual help system' for XOOPS, inspired by the one on the Developers Forge. I found that idea more than brilliant, so I decided to start coding the thing !

As I was new in the developers world, I had to look for quality ideas that had already been established and represented the best in Xoops programming. I chose the Soapbox module by hsalazar (Horacio Salazar) which I had found absolutely amazing ! So, many thanks to Horacio, as his work offered considerable inspiration. I would also like to thank him for helping me establish the workflow of the SmartFAQ module, as well as for helping me in all the development process.

When about half the coding was done, I met a special Xoopser who would become an important player in this project : w4z004 (Sergio Kohl). Many thanks to you w4z004, as you multiplied many times the possibilities and potential of this module. By testing it over and over again, by submitting the code to be checked by security experts and other advanced developers, by suggesting more features, by encouraging me when things were not going the way I wanted and by doing a thousand other things for this project. Thank you, thank you, thank you !

Special thanks also to Mithrandir (Jan Pedersen) for all the 'little' answers to my 'little' questions (lol). You made my life so much easier by helping me see things more clearly !

I would also like to thank Mariuss (Marius Scurtescu) for adapting FAQ for New Xoopsers for SmartFAQ, for developing the import scripts, for teaching me the CVS (lol) as well as for suggesting a lot of interesting improvements along the way.

Another special thank-you to Carnuke (Richard Strauss) for writing such impressive documentation for this module. You have now set up a new quality standard for XOOPS module documentation. I'm confident that all the Xoopsers of the world are gratefull for this :-) !

Finally, thanks to all the people who made this module possible : Herko, phppp, Solo71, Yoyo2021, Christian, Hervé and so many others ! Also, a final thank to Zabou who has been really understanding during all the hours I spent behind my laptop developing SmartFAQ.

So I guess this is it, I could thank the Academy, my Mother and Father but that would be pushing it I think ! (lol)

Enjoy SmartFAQ !
