How to install SmartFAQ
=======================

SmartFAQ is installed as a regular XOOPS module, which means you should copy the complete /smartfaq folder into the
/modules directory of your website. Then, log in to your site as administrator, go to System Admin > Modules, look for
the SmartFAQ icon in the list of uninstalled modules and click in the install icon. Follow the directions in the screen
and you'll be ready to go.
